# Differential-Equations-Octave

Based on uni exercises and project(Problem1 and Problem2). 
Some of the code is written in Matlab and the other in Octave, so issues with running certain files in Octave is the use of the Matlab function movie. A possible way to do "video" graphics in Octave is shown in Problem1 and Problem2.
